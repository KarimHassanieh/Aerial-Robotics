## Programming Project 1 - PD Control of Quadrator height in 1-D

_**Objective**_ The goal of  this exercise is  to implement a PD controller to control the height of a quadrotor, as well
as tune its gains. The controller only contains a Proportional and Derivate gain. In addition the input should
have a rise time of less than 1s and a maximum overshoot of less than 5%.
